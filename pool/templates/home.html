<p>Thank you for your interest in the 2019 Playoff Pool.</p>
<p>The first Divisional week game has started, so no further entries may be added.</p>
{% else %}
<p>Welcome to the 2019 NFL Playoff Pool</p>
<p>The pool runs for 3 rounds, Divisional playoffs through Super Bowl.  For each game in the round, you'll pick a winner and a margin of victory.  You accumulate points based on the difference between your predicted margin and the actual outcome.  Points are doubled in Week 2 and multiplied by 4 in the Super Bowl.  The goal is to have the fewest total points at the end.</p>
<p><b>EXAMPLE:</b> You pick the Patriots to win by 3. They lose by 7. You were off by 10. In the first round, this would cost you 10 points. In the second round, this would cost you 20 points, and in the Super Bowl 40 points.</p>
<p>Entry fee is $20 and should be paid prior to the first game on Saturday.  Payment can be made via PayPal to thayosh@gmail.com. Please use the friends and family option to avoid PayPal fees being deducted.</p>
<p><b>PAYOUT:</b></p>
<p><b>3rd place</b> - Gets the $20 back</p>
<p><b>2nd place</b> - 30% of the remaining pot.</p>
<p><b>1st place</b> - 70% of the remaining pot.</p>
